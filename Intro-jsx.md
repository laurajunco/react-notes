# Intro to JSX

### What is JSX?
- a basic unit of JSX is called JSX element
- an example of a JSX element: 

```javascript
<h1>Hello world</h1>
```
- it looks exactlly linea html but you would find it in a javascript file

### JSX Elements and their surroundings
- JSX elementes are treated as javascript expressions
- A JSX element can be saved in a variable, passed to a function, stored in an object or array...

### Attributes in JSX
- JSX elements can have attributes, just like HTML elements can.
- They work the same as html attributes

```javascript
const p1 = <p id = "large"> foo </p>;
const p2 = <p id = "small"> bar </p>;
```

### Nested JSX
- You can nest JSX elements inside of other JSX elements, just like in HTML.
- If a JSX expression takes up more than one line, then you must wrap the multi-line JSX expression in parentheses:

```javascript
(
  <a href="https://www.example.com">
    <h1>
      Click me!
    </h1>
  </a>
);
```

```javascript
const myDiv = (
  <div> 
    <h1> Hello world </h1>
  </div>
);
```

### JSX outer elements

- JSX expression must have exactly one outermost element.
- The first opening tag and the final closing tag of a JSX expression must belong to the same JSX element!
- The solution is usually simple: wrap the JSX expression in a div.

```javascript
const paragraphs = (
  <div id="i-am-the-outermost-element">
    <p>I am a paragraph.</p>
    <p>I, too, am a paragraph.</p>
  </div>
);
```

### Rendering JSX
- To *render* a JSX expression means to make it appear on screen

- The following code will render a JSX expression:

```javascript
ReactDOM.render(<h1>Hello world</h1>, document.getElementById('app'));
```

- React is a JavaScript library for building User Interfaces and ReactDOM is the JavaScript library that allows React to interact with the DOM.

### ReactDOM.render() I
- *ReactDOM.render()* is the most common way to render JSX.
- It takes a JSX expression, turns it into html elements and adds it to the html document
- *First argument*: the JSX expression to be rendered

### ReactDOM.render() II
- The first argument is appended to whatever element is selected by the second argument.

This:
```javascript
ReactDOM.render(<h1>Render me!</h1>, document.getElementById('container'));
```
Will be rendered like this:

```html
<main id="container">
  <h1>Render me!</h1>
</main>
```

### Passing a Variable to ReactDOM.render()

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

// Write code here:
const myList = (
  <ul>
    <li> Element </li>
    <li> Element </li>
    <li> Element </li>
  </ul>
);

ReactDOM.render( myList, document.getElementById( 'app' ));
```

### The virtual DOM
- ReactDOM.render() only updates DOM elements that have changed.
- If you render the exact same thing twice in a row, the second render will do nothing

Hereâ€™s what happens when you try to update the DOM in React:

1. The entire virtual DOM gets updated.
2. The virtual DOM gets compared to what it looked like before you updated it. React figures out which objects have changed.
3. The changed objects, and the changed objects only, get updated on the real DOM.
4. Changes on the real DOM cause the screen to change.
