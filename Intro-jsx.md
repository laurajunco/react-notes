# Intro to JSX

- React.js is a javascript library

"const h1 = <h1> Hello world </h1>;" Whats is this?


### What is JSX?
- a basic unit of JSX is called JSX element
- an example of a JSX element: <h1>Hello world</h1>
- it looks exactlly linea html but you would find it in a javascript file

### JSX Elements and their surroundings
- JSX elementes are treated as javascript expressions
- A JSX element can be saved in a variable, passed to a function, stored in an object or array...

### Attributes in JSX
- JSX elements can have attributes, just like HTML elements can.
- They work the same as html attributes

"const p1 = <p id = "large"> foo </p>;
const p2 = <p id = "small"> bar </p>;"

### Nested JSX
- You can nest JSX elements inside of other JSX elements, just like in HTML.
- If a JSX expression takes up more than one line, then you must wrap the multi-line JSX expression in parentheses:

"(
  <a href="https://www.example.com">
    <h1>
      Click me!
    </h1>
  </a>
)"
